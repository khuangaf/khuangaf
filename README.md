### What's up!


I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. Heng Ji. My research interest lies in fact-checking, corrective explanations for misinformation, and factually consistent text generation. Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and my Master's degree from the University of Southern California.
